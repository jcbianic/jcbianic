### Hi there, I'm Jean-Christophe ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy building stuff with software and data, and I've been doing so for nearly a decade.

Python as my primary language. I use Flask quite a lot, do a bunch of query-building in dbt and BigQuery or even SQLAlchemy. I can throw in a bit of Machine Learning when needed (which is not that often it turns out), and build a modern front-end with Vue.js and Nuxt.js (although this is clearly my weak spot).

Over the years, I have led multiple teams of various sizes and profiles, helping them grow and achieve our goals.

In another life, I was a PhD student studying how organisations either foster or hinder individual creativity. I now experience it first-hand in technical teams and find it far more interesting this way.
